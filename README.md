# kickstarter-trend-visualizer

[**Kickstarter**](https://www.kickstarter.com/) maintains a global crowdfunding platform focused on creativity. Kickstarter allows creators to share new project ideas for creative work with the communities that will come together to fund them. Kickstarter.csv contains data about Kickstarter projects under the “Technology” category for the years 2009 - 2016. The attributes are self-explanatory. This is a modified version of the dataset available [**here**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kemical/kickstarter-projects?resource=download).

# Data Visualization Tasks

## Task 1: Category Analysis

1. **Change in Categories Over the Years**
    - Create a visualization to show how the distribution of project categories has changed over the years.

2. **Success Rate of Projects for Each Category Over the Years**
    - Create a visualization to display the success rates of projects within each category over the years.

3. **Popularity of Categories vs. Success Rate**
    - Create a visualization that compares the popularity of categories (average backers per project) against the success rate of projects for each category.

## Task 2: Additional Insights

1. **Average of Pledged**
    - Using the interactive decomposition tree, key features that affect for average pledged can be seen.

2. **Sum of pledged**
    - In this funnel chart, it can be observed that the total sum pledged in the platform has been steadily rising throughout the years.

Please include clear titles and labels for your visualizations to make the information easily understandable. You can use appropriate chart types (e.g., bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, etc.) and data visualization tools to complete these tasks.
